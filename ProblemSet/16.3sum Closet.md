# 3Sum Closet
Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.

Return the sum of the three integers.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

## My first thoughts
Very similar to the Question15
    
1. Sort the list. Set res to $inf$.
2. Left pointer is always less than the right pointer 
3. The first element is iterated by order. The second are the next element and the third is the last. So we have $a>b>c$. We have $\bigtriangleup(sum-target)$ and  $\bigtriangleup(sum-res)$. Determine whether $\bigtriangleup(sum-target)$ is less than  $\bigtriangleup(sum-res)$. Then compare the sum and the target.

My first solution
```python 
def threeSumClosest(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        nums.sort()
        res =  99999
        for id,a in enumerate(nums):
            
            # Prevent a from duplication
            # b might be the same as a so we have to find previous a
            id_b = id + 1
            id_c = len(nums) - 1
            while(id_c>id_b):
                b = nums[id_b]
                c = nums[id_c]
                sum = a + b + c
                delta_res = abs(target-res)
                delta_sum = abs(target-sum)
                if sum == target:
                    return target
                if delta_sum < delta_res:
                    res = sum
                if sum > target:
                    id_c-=1
                else:
                    id_b+=1
        return res
```

Now optimize it! For a, we do not need to iterate all elements in the list.
Final solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def threeSumClosest(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        nums.sort()
        res =  99999
        for id,a in enumerate(nums[:-2]):
            id_b = id + 1
            id_c = len(nums) - 1
            while(id_c>id_b):
                sum = a + nums[id_b] + nums[id_c]
                if sum == target:
                    return target
                if abs(target-sum) < abs(target-res):
                    res = sum
                if sum > target:
                    id_c-=1
                else:
                    id_b+=1
        return res
