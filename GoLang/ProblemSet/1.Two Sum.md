# Two Sum
Given an array of integers numsÂ and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1.
```python
>Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```
My first solution:
```
```python
def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(len(nums)):
                if i == j:
                    continue 
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i,j]
```
Obviously, it is not the best solu. 
It needs $O$($n^2$) time complexity and $O$($1$) space complexity.


Here is a better solution using Hash Table which needs $O$($n$) time complexity and $O$($n$) space complexity. 


Note: In Python, Dict could be a hash table. In other languages, map could be a hash table.


Here is the how we map keys and values. $H(x) = idx(x)$. We record what we have found and the index of that number. We only need to find $target-x$



```
def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        hash_table = dict()
        for idx,num in enumerate(nums):
            if target-num in hash_table.keys(): 
            # It should be faster if we use hash_table instead of hash_table.keys() 
                return [idx,hash_table[target-num]]
            else:
                hash_table[num] = idx
```

So the final solution should be 
```
def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        hash_table = dict()
        for idx,num in enumerate(nums):
            if target-num in hash_table: 
                return [idx,hash_table[target-num]]
            else:
                hash_table[num] = idx
```
