# 45. Jump Game II

You are given a $0-indexed$ array of integers $nums$ of length $n$. You are initially positioned at $nums[0]$.

Each element $nums[i]$ represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index $i$. In other words, if you are at $nums[i]$, you can jump to any $nums[i + j]$ where:

$0 <= j <= nums[i] $ and $i + j < n$

Return the minimum number of jumps to reach $nums[n - 1]$. The test cases are generated such that you can reach $nums[n - 1]$.


## My first solution
BFS
Using BFS to search each time and store in the $WL$,find $max(index + nums[index])$ in $WL$.

Note: !!!
```python
def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        # end is the max value we can reach now
        # maxPos is the max value we can reach next 
        maxPos, end, step ,temp = 0, 0, 0, 0
        n = len(nums) - 1
        while end < n:
            maxPos = max(maxPos, temp + nums[temp])
            if end ==  temp:
                step+=1
                end = max_Pos

            # We have to iterate from temp to end to find the max value we can get in the next step!!! 
            temp += 1
               
        return step
```
