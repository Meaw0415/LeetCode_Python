# 880. Decoded String at Index
You are given an encoded string s. To decode the string to a tape, the encoded string is read one character at a time and the following steps are taken:

    If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
    
    If the character read is a digit d, the entire current tape is repeatedly written d - 1 more times in total.

Given an integer k, return the kth letter (1-indexed) in the decoded string.



Example
```
Input: s = "leet2code3", k = 10
Output: "o"
Explanation: The decoded string is "leetleetcodeleetleetcodeleetleetcode".
The 10th letter in the string is "o".
```
```
Input: s = "ha22", k = 5
Output: "h"
Explanation: The decoded string is "hahahaha".
The 5th letter is "h".
```

```
Input: s = "a2345678999999999999999", k = 1
Output: "a"
Explanation: The decoded string is "a" repeated 8301530446056247680 times.
The 1st letter is "a".
```

## My Solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def decodeAtIndex(self, s, k):
        """
        :type s: str
        :type k: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        res = ''
        
        for i in s:
            if i.isdecimal():
                for i in range(int(i)-1):
                    res += res
            else:
                res += i
        # print(res)
        return res[k-1]
```
But it will run out of time!


So, we first find the encoded string which is the same as my solu.

逆向模拟，由于题目规模较大，要用 BigInt 
  举例：S = "leet2code3", K = 10
  1. 正向求出 S 的总长度 size = 36
  2. 逆向遍历 S，区分遇到数字和字母的情况
     遇到 3, k = 10 % 36 = 10, size = 36 / 3 = 12;
     遇到 e, k = 10 % 12 = 10, size--, size = 11
     遇到 d, k = 10 % 11 = 10, size--, size = 10
     遇到 o, k = 10 % 10 = 0,  k === 0, 返回 'o'

```
```python
class Solution(object):
    def decodeAtIndex(self, S, K):
        size = 0
        # Find size = length of decoded string
        for c in S:
            if c.isdigit():
                size *= int(c)
            else:
                size += 1

        for c in reversed(S):
            K %= size
            if K == 0 and c.isalpha():
                return c

            if c.isdigit():
                size /= int(c)
            else:
                size -= 1

```
