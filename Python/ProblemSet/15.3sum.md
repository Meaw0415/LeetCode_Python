# 3Sum
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets $[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]$ such that $i != j, i != k, $ and $j != k$, and $nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0$.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

## My first thoughts
1. Brute force.(Very bad) $O(n^3)$ Crazy!!
2. Hash table with double pointers
    
    1. Sort the list.
    2. Left pointer is always less than the right pointer 
    3. The first element is iterated by order. The second are the next element and the third is the last. So we have $a>b>c$
```python 
def threeSum(nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        nums.sort()

        res =  []
        for id,a in enumerate(nums):
            if a>0:
                break
            id_b = id + 1
            id_c = len(nums) - 1
            while(id_c>id_b):
                b = nums[id_b]
                c = nums[id_c]
                sum = a + b+ c
                if sum ==0:
                    res.append([a,b,c])
                    id_b += 1
                    id_c -= 1
                elif sum<0:
                    id_b += 1
                else:
                    id_c -= 1
        return res
```
The problem is that I didn't eliminate the repeated condition.
The repeated problem only occur in neighbors

```python 
def threeSum(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        nums.sort()
        res =  []
        for id,a in enumerate(nums):
            
            if a>0:
                return res
            # Prevent a from duplication
            # b might be the same as a so we have to find previous a
            if id >= 1 and a==nums[id-1]:
                continue
            id_b = id + 1
            id_c = len(nums) - 1
            while(id_c>id_b):
                b = nums[id_b]
                c = nums[id_c]
                sum = a + b+ c
                if sum ==0:
                    res.append([a,b,c])
                    # Prevent b,c from duplication
                    while(id_c>id_b and nums[id_b] == nums[id_b+1]):
                        id_b += 1
                        while(id_c>id_b and nums[id_c] == nums[id_c-1]):
                            id_c -= 1
                    # Still need to plus one because these are still previous ones
                    id_b += 1
                    id_c -= 1
                elif sum<0:
                    id_b += 1
                else:
                    id_c -= 1
        return res
```
