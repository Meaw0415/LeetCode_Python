# 98. Validate Binary Search Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

    The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
    Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.



Example:

```python
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true
```

Example:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree2.jpg)

```python
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
```

## My first thought
1. Resursive
```python
def isValidBST(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        
        return self.vbst(root,float('inf'),float('-inf'))
    def vbst(self,root,max_num,min_num):
        if not root:
            return True
        tem = root.val
        if tem >= max_num or tem <= min_num:
            return False
        # Nodes in right subtree should larger than the node's val
        # So the minimun should be the node's val
        # Same for the left node
        if not self.vbst(root.right,max_num,tem):
            return False
        if not self.vbst(root.left,tem,min_num):
            return False
        return True

```
