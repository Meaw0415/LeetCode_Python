# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

## Example
```python
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

```

## My first thoughts
1. hash_table
It seems like I still use the brute force...


Note: We can find optimize it by finding the repeated one. It becomes sliding windows. 
```python
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        res = 0
        ht = dict()
        start = 0
        sub_start = 0
        while(start<len(s)):
            symbol = s[start]
            if symbol in ht:
                start = sub_start + 1
                sub_start = start
                if len(ht.keys()) > res:
                    res = len(ht.keys())
                ht = dict()
                
            else:
                ht[symbol] = 0
                start+=1
        if len(ht.keys()) > res:
            res = len(ht.keys())
        return res
```

2. Sliding Window 

    1. Make sure the character in the window is unique.
    2. Once u move the right border and find the repeated character. Move the left boder to make sure the rule 1.

```python 
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self,s):    
        res = [0]
        ht = dict()
        end = 0
        start = 0
        while(end<len(s)):
            symbol = s[end]
            if symbol in ht:
                # Move the left border
                # Remember to make sure the new_start should larger than the start
                start = start if start> ht[symbol] + 1 else ht[symbol] + 1
                ht[symbol] = end
            else:
                ht[symbol] = end
            res.append(end - start + 1)
            end += 1
        return max(res)
```
