# Valid Parentheses


Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

    Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
    Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Example

Input: s = "()"
Output: true

## My first thought
Obviously, it's easier to use stack to solve this question.
Note: List in python works the same as the stack.

```python
def isValid(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        stack = []

        for i in s:
            if len(stack)==0:
                stack.append(i)
                continue
            # Convert Char to Hex number
            if ord(stack[-1]) == ord(i)-1 or ord(stack[-1]) == ord(i)-2:
                stack.pop(-1)
            else:
                stack.append(i)
        if len(stack)==0:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

## Better Solution
Using the Dict to store the right quotation.
```python
def isValid(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        stack = ['!']
        hasht = {'(' : ')' , '[': ']','{':'}','!':'!'}
        for i in s:
            if i in hasht:
                stack.append(i)
            # Once the poped element is not equal to the push one 
            # The string won't be complete
            elif hasht[stack.pop()] != i:
                return False
        return len(stack)==1
```
