# 100. Same Tree

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.



Example:

```
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
```

```
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
```


## My first thoughts
1. Using in order search to find the list of the BST.
    
    This method may need more time

2. Search two tree at the same time. Once the node is different, return false.

Actually the condition can be optimized.

```python 
class Solution(object):
    def isSameTree(self, p, q):
        """
        :type p: TreeNode
        :type q: TreeNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        ## Helper function to search
        def inorder(root1,root2):
            # Return False except two nodes are NULL or two nodes' value are the same
            if root1 is None and root2 is None:
                return True
            if root1 and root2:
                if root1.val != root2.val:
                    return False
            else:
                return False
            # Recursive for left nodes and right nodes
            if not inorder(root1.right,root2.right):
                return False
            if not inorder(root1.left,root2.left):
                return False

            return True

        return inorder(p,q)
```
