# Container With Most Water
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

```python 
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

## My First Thoughts
1. Brute force (Bad!)
2. For each left wall, u can find the weight of the water. (Still Brute Force)
    
    1. If the right wall is higher. $h(left) * width$
    2. If the left wall is higher. $h(right) * width$

So my first solution
```python
def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        res = 0
        for idx,left_wall in enumerate(height[:-1]):
            right_walls = height[idx+1:]
            b = [(idd+1)*left_wall if i>left_wall else (idd+1)*i for idd,i in enumerate(right_walls)]
            if res < max(b):
                res = max(b)
        return res
``` 
The answer should be right but run out of time

## Final Solution
Double pointer problem.
The start point and the end point.
1. Calculate the weight. 
   $weight$ = $min(v1,v2)*distance$
2. Move the pointer of min(v1,v2). And calculate the weight again.
3. Stop until two pointers meet

```python
def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        ans = 0
        while l < r:
            area = min(height[l], height[r]) * (r - l)
            ans = max(ans, area)
            if height[l] <= height[r]:
                l += 1
            else:
                r -= 1
        return ans
```

## Note: Proof of the double pointer

Moving the max pointer is meaningless because the weight is up to the min height.

Assume $i$ and $j$ are twp pointers. $H(i)$ and $H(j)$ mean height of the pointers. $n$ is the length of the list. $S(i,j) = min(H(i),H(j)) * (j-i)$ is the area of the $(i,j)$

From the algorithm above, we can know at least one of $H(i)$ and $H(j)$ are the maximum between $[0,i]$ and $[j,n-1]$

For the initial state, $i = 0$, $j = n-1$. If $H(0) < H(n-1)$, we will cancel $(0,1),(0,2)...(0,n)$, because we will move $i$ from 0 to 1. We have to make sure whether the canceled pairs are calculated or can be proved less than what we calculated.

By induction. we can prove that.
