# Remove Nth Node From End of List
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.


## My first solution
```python 




def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type n: int
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        if head.next is None:
            return None
        ht = []
        start = head
        
        while(start is not None):
            ht.append(start)
            start = start.next

        start = head
        length = len(ht)
        if n==length:
            return start.next

        temp = length-n-1 if length-n-1 >=0 else 0
        
        while head != ht[temp]:
            head = head.next
        temp = length - n

        head.next = ht[temp].next

        return start
```
We have to consider the first node. But we can add a dummy node to simplify it. Or we can use Stack to solve.
```python
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        def getLength(head: ListNode) -> int:
            length = 0
            while head:
                length += 1
                head = head.next
            return length
        
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        length = getLength(head)
        cur = dummy
        for i in range(1, length - n + 1):
            cur = cur.next
        cur.next = cur.next.next
        return dummy.next

```
Here is another simple solution . Set two pointers such that two pointers has $n$ nodes away. When the second one reaches the end. The first is the last $n^{th}$ node.

```python
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        first = head
        second = dummy
        for i in range(n):
            first = first.next

        while first:
            first = first.next
            second = second.next
        
        second.next = second.next.next
        return dummy.next

```
